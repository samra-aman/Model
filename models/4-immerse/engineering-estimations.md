description: "An Estimate is a best faith prediction of the effort that will be expended to perform a task.  It has tolerance and distribution, and may depend on other factors beyond the estimators control.  An Estimate is the opinion of a professional"

##Why
Engineering estimations convey product managers how much cost and effort will be required for various enginnering activities. It helps them to make informed decisions to control the project more efficiently and effectively.

##How
There are several methods to perform engineering estimations. They have their advantages and disadvantages. However the most popular engieering estimation method is Tast/Method estimation also known as "Bottom up Estimation"

- Task/Method Estimation
  We break large tasks or stories in to discrete, easy to understand incremental tasks. These tasks can easily be assinged among project team members. Each task is comprised of task specification, Condition Of Satisfaction(COS), estimated time of completion, test functionalies etc..

When deriving estimations of testing requirements, it is highly recommended that the following factors be taken into account:

•	Risks and Complexity of the application : It is important that the size of the system is taken into account when estimating the test effort.

•	Types of testing required : Effort estimates should be derived for each type of testing that would be identified as part of the Quality Assurance Strategy. eg. for load testing , installation testing, Accessibility testing etc

•	Manual or Automated testing : Effort required to create test cases and maintain them or effort required to set up automation should be taken into account. 

•	Test Data : If the test data is not available, you should estimate the effort it would take to create and maintain test data.

•	Test Cycles :This should include number of test cycles required prior to promoting the system to production.  A test cycle could typically include smoke tests along with a complete system test   

•	Supporting Activities –Take into account retesting, Regression testing and bug reporting

•	Integrated systems and integration points

•	Internal and External dependencies 

•	Environment Setup - Setting up of development , test , staging environments.

•	Early test phases - unit testing , Integration testing

•	The need to ramp up, train, and orient team members

•	Prototype Validation (if applicable)

- Comparison to Actuals
  This is also called analogous estimation. You use the knowledge of the company to find similar tasks to the one you are anticipating.
